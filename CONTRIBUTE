# How to contribute to the project
Fork the repository under your namespace (by clicking the fork button on the top right).
Clone the forked repository to your local machine and create a virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the global and dev dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```
Setup pre-commit hooks by running the following command:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

Make your modifications in your local repository. Don't forget to run the tests before committing your changes by running the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Commit your changes with a descriptive message (you could link the issue you are working on for example using `#<issue_number>` in the commit message). Then push your changes to your forked repository. 

Once you are done with your changes, you can create a pull request to the main repository. To do this, follow these steps:
* Go to the main repository and click on the "Pull requests" tab
* Click on the "New pull request" button
* Select the branch you want to merge into (usually `develop`)
* Select the branch you want to merge from (your forked repository)
* Add a title and description for your pull request
* Assign the pull request to the appropriate person (usually the maintainer of the repository)
* Add any relevant labels or milestones
* Click on the "Create pull request" button
* Wait for the maintainer to review your pull request and make any necessary changes
* Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository
